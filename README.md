# Drug-Activity-Challenges

• Multitask :activity for each bioassay individually.

• Unbalancedlabels :different amount of actives/inactives.

• Sparselabels :not all compound-assay pairs have measurements.

• Masking :unknown samples need to be masked out for loss/evaluation.


#Data

• Trainingset

◦ Compounds as SMILES strings

◦ Activity value per compound-assay pair

◦ Activity values: 1 (active), 0 (unknown), -1 (inactive)


• Testset

◦ Compounds as SMILES strings
